The example application manages products: display, search, pagination, deletion, addition, editing, updating, and authentication

Use:
- username: admin & password: admin to login as admin (full privileges)
- username: user & password: user to login as user (limited privileges)

## Through this project, I covered:
- Angular architecture
- Fundamental concepts: Modules, Web Components, Data Binding, Services, Pipes, Directives, Routing, Http
- Creating a template page using Bootstrap and Bootstrap-icons with routing system
- All aspects of web components
- Model creation
- Services and dependency injection
- Using RXJS Observables
- Pagination mechanism
- Creating an authentication system
- ReactiveForms with form validation
